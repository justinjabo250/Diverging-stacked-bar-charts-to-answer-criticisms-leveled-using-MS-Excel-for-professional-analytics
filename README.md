# Diverging-stacked-bar-charts-to-answer-criticisms-leveled-using-MS-Excel-for-professional-analytics

This project focuses on diverging stacked bar charts, which are meant to show the spread of positive and negative values, such as Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (without a Neutral category). These charts address a criticism of regular stacked bar charts, namely that it is challenging to compare the values of the categories in the middle of the stack. 

I will therefore offer all necessary recommendations, actions, measures, and corrections after analyzing the data using bar charts for visual analysis. I will also provide the necessary conclusions and solutions and decisions. All of this will be utilized to provide the institution (company) with profitable and beneficial insights from their data.
